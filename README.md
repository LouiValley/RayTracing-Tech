# Ray Tracing Tech 

Nowadays ray tracing is a fantastic tech in a rendering pipeline.
This is a paper list about the most important techs and some hard core knowledge about ray tracing.
There will be a collection of papers that interest me. The emphasis is focused on, but not limited to raytracing itself. Papers of significance are marked in **bold**. My comments are marked in *italic*.

## My Contributions
I have been working on energy-efficient architecture design for deep learning. Some featured works are presented here. And now I do some researches and engineering work about ray tracing tech.

- [**Deep Convolutional Neural Network Architecture with Reconfigurable Computation Patterns.**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8412607) (**TCAD**)
  - *This work aims to accelerate a generative network, which includes CONV layers, DeCONV layers and residual blocks.*
  - *A dual convolution mapping method for CONV and DeCONV layers to make full use of the available PE resources.*
  - *Precision-adaptive PEs and buffer bandwidth reconfiguration are used to support flexible bitwidths for both inputs and weights in deep neural networks*
  - * A cross-layer scheduling method is also proposed to avoid extra off-chip memory access in residual block processing*
